# Wave Guide: Your Personal Music Journey

## System Overview

Wave Guide creates personalized music playlists that take listeners on a "journey" from a starting track to a destination track, discovering new music along the way. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that optimize for similarity alone, Wave Guide treats playlist generation as a path-finding problem through multidimensional audio feature space.

The system addresses a critical limitation in existing music platforms: Spotify recently restricted API access to recommendation endpoints, making proprietary solutions unsustainable. Wave Guide leverages AcousticBrainz, an open-source database containing acoustic analysis for millions of tracks (71-dimensional feature vectors including energy, valence, timbre, rhythm, and tonal characteristics).

Users specify source and destination tracks (or moods). The system encodes music theory knowledge and transition smoothness rules as a propositional logic knowledge base, then uses A* search to find optimal paths through feature space that satisfy these constraints. For each waypoint along the path, vector similarity retrieval identifies real tracks from AcousticBrainz. A machine learning classifier enables mood-based queries by mapping abstract moods to concrete feature vectors. The final playlist balances smooth transitions, stylistic diversity, and adherence to music theory principles—creating journeys that feel intentional rather than algorithmically random. This integrated approach demonstrates how multiple AI techniques combine to solve a real-world problem: making music discovery both systematic and serendipitous.

## Modules

### Module 1: Music Feature Knowledge Base

**Topics:** Propositional Logic (Knowledge Bases, Inference, Logical Rules, Entailment)

**Input:** AcousticBrainz high-level and low-level feature data (JSON format containing 71-dimensional vectors: mood features, genre probabilities, danceability, acousticness, energy, valence, timbre coefficients, rhythm patterns). User-defined constraints (optional): tempo range, key compatibility preferences, mood requirements.

**Output:** A propositional knowledge base encoding music theory rules and transition compatibility constraints. Rules represented as logical clauses (e.g., "IF energy > 0.8 AND valence < 0.3 THEN mood = intense" or "IF |tempo_diff| > 30 THEN transition_rough = true"). Includes inference engine capable of validating whether a proposed track sequence satisfies encoded constraints.

**Integration:** This module serves as the foundational constraint validator for the entire system. Module 2 (A* Search) queries this KB to evaluate path validity—paths violating KB rules incur higher costs. Module 5 (Playlist Assembly) performs final validation, ensuring the complete playlist satisfies all logical constraints before presentation to the user.

**Prerequisites:** Propositional Logic content (Weeks 1-1.5). No prior modules required—this is the foundational module establishing system constraints.

### Module 2: Optimal Path Search

**Topics:** Search Algorithms (Beam Search)

**Input:** Source track feature vector (71-dimensional), destination track feature vector (71-dimensional), knowledge base rules from Module 1, playlist length parameter (default: 7 tracks including bookends).

**Output:** Ordered sequence of intermediate feature vectors representing optimal path through audio feature space. For a 7-track playlist: [source_vector, waypoint1, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4, waypoint5, destination_vector]. Each waypoint is a point in 71-dimensional space satisfying KB constraints while minimizing total path cost.

**Integration:** Receives source/destination from user input (or Module 4 if mood-based). Queries Module 1's KB during search to evaluate state validity. Outputs waypoint vectors to Module 3 for track retrieval. Improves upon naive linear interpolation by finding paths that avoid KB rule violations and minimize perceptual "roughness" in transitions.

**Prerequisites:** Search content (Weeks 2.5-4). Requires Module 1 (KB must exist to evaluate path validity).

**Algorithm Details:** Search space is continuous 71-dimensional feature space discretized into grid cells. Heuristic function: Euclidean distance to destination weighted by KB rule violation penalties. Cost function: Cumulative distance plus transition smoothness penalty derived from feature delta magnitudes. Beam search is used to efficiently explore the search space by maintaining a limited number of promising paths. It is constrained to ensure a minimum playlist length as specified by the user.

### Module 3: Playlist Optimization via Simulated Annealing

**Topics:** Advanced Search/Optimization (Simulated Annealing, Local Search, Optimization)

**Input:** Playlist of tracks with metadata including tempo, key, energy level, valence, and feature vectors. Tracks are provided in the order generated by Module 2's path search, with real tracks retrieved via vector similarity from AcousticBrainz.

**Output:** Reordered playlist optimized for listening flow, along with optimization metrics showing initial flow score, final flow score, and improvement percentage. The flow score quantifies smoothness of transitions across tempo, key compatibility, and energy progression.

**Integration:** Takes the initial playlist assembled from Module 2's waypoints and enhances it through intelligent reordering. While A* search finds an optimal path through feature space, the actual retrieved tracks may not perfectly match waypoint vectors—simulated annealing fine-tunes the final ordering to maximize transition smoothness. The optimized playlist feeds into Module 5 for final validation against the KB rules. This module can also incorporate mood labels from Module 4 when available, considering emotional flow during optimization.

**Prerequisites:** Advanced search techniques including hill climbing, simulated annealing, and optimization fundamentals (Weeks 6.5-7.5). Depends on Module 2 for input playlists.

**Algorithm Details:** Neighbor function: swap adjacent tracks or move a track to a new position. Energy function: sum of transition penalties (tempo difference, key incompatibility, energy jumps). Cooling schedule: exponential decay with initial temperature tuned to accept ~80% of initial moves.

### Module 4: Mood Classification and Feature Mapping

**Topics:** Machine Learning (Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression or Neural Networks, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation)

**Input:** Training data: AcousticBrainz tracks with manually labeled moods (Calm, Energized, Happy, Sad, Intense, Chill—approximately 1000+ labeled examples per mood). Inference input: Either a track's 71-dimensional feature vector OR a mood label string.

**Output:**
- **Training phase**: Trained classifier model saved as pickle file with evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score per mood class).
- **Inference phase**: If given features → mood label with confidence score. If given mood label → representative feature vector (cluster centroid) for that mood category.

**Integration:** Enables mood-based playlist creation. When users select "Calm" as source and "Energized" as destination, this module converts mood labels to feature vectors, which then feed into Module 2 (A* Search) as source/destination points. Allows users to specify abstract emotional journeys rather than requiring knowledge of specific tracks.

**Prerequisites:** Machine Learning content (Week 12+). Can be developed independently from other modules initially, integrated later. For early checkpoints, hardcode mood-to-feature mappings; replace with trained model by Checkpoint 4.

### Module 5: Playlist Assembly and Validation

**Topics:** System Integration, Constraint Satisfaction

**Input:** Source and destination tracks (IDs or mood labels), user preferences (playlist length, optional filters). Waypoint feature vectors from Module 2. Track metadata from vector similarity retrieval for each waypoint.

**Output:** Complete playlist object containing: ordered list of track metadata (title, artist, album, ISRC), playlist name generated from source/destination labels, feature progression graph (visualizing energy/valence/danceability journey), validation report confirming KB rule compliance from Module 1.

**Integration:** This is the orchestration module that ties the entire system together. Workflow: (1) If mood-based input, query Module 4 for feature vectors; (2) Pass features to Module 2 for A* path generation; (3) For each waypoint, retrieve matching track via vector similarity search against AcousticBrainz/Qdrant; (4) Pass assembled playlist to Module 3 for simulated annealing optimization; (5) Validate final sequence against Module 1's KB; (6) If validation fails, request alternative tracks and re-optimize; (7) Format output for user presentation. Handles edge cases: no valid path exists, insufficient tracks in database, user interrupts generation.

**Prerequisites:** No new AI topics—integration logic only. Requires all prior modules (1-4) to be functional. Suitable for final checkpoint after all components exist.

**Timeline Rationale:**
- Modules 1-2 tackle required topics (Logic + Search) early, establishing core path-finding functionality by Checkpoint 1.
- Module 3 leverages optimization concepts taught mid-semester, allowing refinement of playlist flow through simulated annealing by Checkpoint 2.
- Module 4 waits for ML content (Week 12+), providing ample time for data labeling and model training by Checkpoint 4.
- Module 5 integrates all components in final checkpoint, with buffer time for debugging and polish before demo (Apr 23).

## Coverage Rationale

**Why these topics fit Wave Guide:**

The music journey metaphor naturally maps to AI search problems—playlists are paths through feature space. **A* search** (required) improves naive interpolation by avoiding "rough" transitions that violate music theory rules. **Propositional logic** (required) encodes domain knowledge: key compatibility, tempo constraints, and mood coherence rules that human DJs intuitively apply.

**Simulated annealing** addresses a key challenge: even with optimal waypoints from A* search, retrieved tracks may not perfectly match target vectors. Playlist flow optimization is an NP-hard sequencing problem well-suited to local search methods—simulated annealing can escape local minima to find smoother track orderings than greedy approaches. **Machine Learning** enables mood-based queries, making the system accessible to users unfamiliar with specific tracks. This transforms abstract emotional intent ("take me from calm to energized") into concrete audio features.

**Trade-offs considered:** Initially considered Reinforcement Learning for user feedback loops (Q-learning to adjust playlist generation from like/dislike signals), but deferred as optional future work due to timeline constraints and complexity of reward function design. Also considered NLP for lyrics analysis to inform mood classification, but AcousticBrainz's acoustic features provide sufficient signal without adding text processing overhead.

The selected topics create a complete system where each module addresses a distinct challenge: knowledge representation (Logic), pathfinding (Search), flow optimization (Simulated Annealing), and user interface abstraction (ML). This demonstrates how multiple AI techniques synergize to solve a real problem—systematic music discovery—in a domain where Spotify's API restrictions have created an open-source opportunity.
